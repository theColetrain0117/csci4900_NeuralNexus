###### This project is brought to you by 3 APSU students and a dream. To create Generative AI GUI System to assist video game developers in generating detailed game mechanics, story ideas, characters, and world-building aspects.

This will allow the developer to enter in some details to the system to generate ideas for them to create visually. 

###### For example: 

The user starts the program and has a general idea of what type of game they would like to create
    by entering an idea of, "I want to create a post-apocolyptic game that's based in outer-space and 
    humanity is on the brink of extinction after settling Mars" 
    
The user can then read the generated idea, and they can choose to either use it as inspiration 
for their own game development or input a new prompt to generate different ideas. 
This back-and-forth interaction makes the process dynamic and tailored to the user's needs,
providing them with creative game design concepts
